## **2. PROJECTS AND TECHNOLOGIES**

### **Q: Tell me about the Toyota project. What were the main challenges?**

**A:** The Toyota project is one of the biggest challenges of my career. I create the website for Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina, making solutions that work well on any device and are easy to use. The main challenges include: connecting with multiple APIs, making the site fast for different countries, keeping the same look between countries and creating specific features for each region.

---

### **Q: How do you use React.js and Next.js in your projects?**

**A:** I use React.js to create code pieces that I can use many times and interfaces that change dynamically. Next.js helps me make the site faster with SSR/SSG, better routing and better for Google to find. In the Toyota project, I use both together to create a smooth and fast user experience, especially important for a big website.

---

### **Q: What's your experience with GraphQL vs REST?**

**A:** I work with both technologies. REST is simpler for traditional APIs, while GraphQL offers more flexibility for searching data. In the Toyota project, I use GraphQL for complicated searches and REST for more direct operations. GraphQL is especially useful when I need specific data without searching unnecessary data.

---

## **3. TECHNICAL SKILLS**

### **Q: How do you apply Clean Code and SOLID principles?**

**A:** Clean Code is fundamental in all my projects. I write code that's easy to read, with names that explain what they do, small functions and each one with one responsibility. SOLID principles help me create code that's easy to maintain: Single Responsibility (each class does one thing), Open/Closed (can extend without changing), Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation and Dependency Inversion.

---

### **Q: What's your experience with automated testing?**

**A:** I create tests in all my projects using Jest and React Testing Library. I test components alone, connections between modules and complete flows. At On2, I maintain many tests to ensure quality and facilitate changes. Tests give me confidence to make changes without breaking existing functionality.

---

### **Q: How do you manage state in React applications?**

**A:** I use different ways depending on complexity: Context API for simple global state, Redux for complicated applications with many reducers, and Custom Hooks for logic I can use many times. In the Toyota project, I use Redux for global state and Context API for local component state.

---

## **4. LEADERSHIP AND MENTORING**

### **Q: How do you mentor the team at On2?**

**A:** I mentor through code reviews, pair programming and knowledge sharing. I help colleagues understand code patterns, best practices and architectures. I also organize learning sessions about new technologies and methodologies. I believe mentoring is a two-way street - I teach and learn at the same time.

---

### **Q: How do you contribute to team knowledge?**

**A:** I contribute through technical documentation, presentations about technologies, constructive code reviews and creating best practice guides. I also organize workshops on specific topics and share project experiences. I believe that shared knowledge is multiplied knowledge.

## **5. COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION**

### **Q: How do you work with multidisciplinary teams?**

**A:** I work well with different profiles because I understand that each person has their expertise. I communicate clearly, adapt my language to the audience and always seek to understand the context before proposing solutions. In the Toyota project, I work with designers, PMs, other devs and stakeholders, always maintaining alignment and efficiency.

---

### **Q: How do you handle feedback and conflicts?**

**A:** I see feedback as a growth opportunity. I listen actively, ask questions to understand better and propose constructive solutions. In conflicts, I seek to understand all perspectives, focus on the problem and not the person, and work to find solutions that benefit everyone. Clear and respectful communication is fundamental.

---

## **6. TIME MANAGEMENT AND ORGANIZATION**

### **Q: How do you manage your time and deadlines?**

**A:** I use agile methodologies like SCRUM and Kanban to organize tasks. I prioritize by impact and urgency, break large tasks into smaller ones and always leave margin for unforeseen events. I communicate proactively about progress and blockers. Organization allows me to deliver quality within deadlines.

---

### **Q: How do you adapt to project changes?**

**A:** Adaptability is one of my main skills. When there are changes, I first understand the context and impact, then propose viable solutions. I maintain mental flexibility and always seek to learn quickly. In the Toyota project, I've already gone through several scope changes and always managed to adapt while maintaining quality.
